# CAMERA TRANSITIONS

A transition is a technique used in audio-visual productions to combine two scenes on after the other. In the film industry this technique is done at the post-production stage but in video games we must have them in mind during all the programming stage.  

Most commonly this is through a normal cut to the next shot. But there are a few differents styles to end a scene and introduce a new one, and with each of them we can produce a different effect at the spectator. 
There are several of them used commonly in films and we we’ll learn how they work forward in this page.

Think I should state that in the following project i will show the most used transitions and the ones most useful for video games from the programming point-of-view. Is it obvious that when we’re in a cinematic or narrative moment in a game the scenes transitions will work exactly the same as a film or any other narrative video. 
But when we’re talking about the player or user around our game we just don’t have characters and narrative elements, we have a amount of menus and differents scenes where the player constantly will be moving and these ones are not the same in a film.


## Types of camera transition:

Fade, Cross Fade, Wipe and Pan and Zoom, these are some of the most used scene transitions in films but useful too in videogames and graphic interfaces, each one has it own meaning and importance. Each one will be transmit something different to the spectator and will be interesting choose wisely the one that you will use in your game.

### Fade:
This simple transition makes the scene gradually fade turning it slowly in a color or to a text slide. This type of transition is slow and creates tension between scenes, for this reasons its useful for transitions between important scenes like the first scenes of a videogame, main menus or at exiting it.

### Cross Fade:
This works similar as the last one but the first scene does not fade to a color or text slide, this one starts fading out at the same time the next scene starts fading in so we combine the fade of the two scenes at the same time. This works faster than a simple fade so i could be useful for pace the change between scenes.

### Wipe:
To make this one clear, it works as cleaning a coating of dust in a image. The dust would be the first scene and the next scene is the image you are cleaning. So at the same time you clean the image and you’re removing the dust(first scene) you can see part of the image(next scene). This gives freedom to the editor because it can be done in a lot of differents ways. It uses to be slow(although you can modify it velocity) so gives some time to the public to think about what have happened in the last scene while you are introducing a new one. The freedom that it gives allows the user to give to it an emotional charge to it depending how you do the wipe.
In these case we could use too a object or element to make the wipe, following the metaphor of cleaning the image these element would be the cloth we’re using to clean the dust and it will give a natural sensation to the scene.

### Pan and Zoom:
This transition is just how its named, it's a simple zoom to some direction to focus in new zone or element in the screen creating an entrance to a new scene. I’ve seen this used in a lot of maps to introduce a location and then what happens there but it can be done too for small elements and characters and this could give a lot more of drama to the scene but that could be considered more as a change of shot or point-of-view.

## The power of camera transitions.

Moving from one moment to another and how you choose to do it will have an incredibly effect to the audience. And doing it right will help in crafting the intended experience for that audience. 

This is the main reason from the point-of-view of a filmaker. If we’re a designer of a videogame we know that during all time our game is running in a determined capability, and when we make loads for an scene these capability will determine if the game freezes or runs slower, these transitions will make us easy to load a scene or level without the player knowing our game is doing so. So hiding these moments will increment the positively thinkning of the player who is in front of the screen.
